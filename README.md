# ðŸŒ± Hi, Marina here! ðŸŒ±

I am an early career data scientist eager to apply my skills to ecology, conservation, and inclusivity in STEM. Outside of my work, you can find me cooking a fresh vegetarian meal, enjoying all things outdoors, and hanging with my pup Tahoma. Learn more on my personal website, [marinakochuten.github.io](https://marinakochuten.github.io).

## What I'm up to 
- ðŸŽ“ I am a recent graduate of [UCSB Bren School's Maters of Environmental Data Science (MEDS)](https://bren.ucsb.edu/masters-programs/master-environmental-data-science) program. My capstone project supported the 2035 Initiative and the Community Labor Center, modeling clean energy job growth in Californiaâ€™s Central Coast to help ensure a just transition.
- ðŸ¦ª Currently, I am working with [Puget Sound Restoration Fund](https://restorationfund.org), where I use data to support restoration of Olympia Oysters and Bull Kelp in the Puget Sound.
