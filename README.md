# ðŸŒ± Hi, Marina here! ðŸŒ±

I am an early career data scientist eager to apply my skills to ecology, conservation, and inclusivity in STEM. Outside of my work, you can find me cooking a fresh vegetarian meal, enjoying all things outdoors, and hanging with my pup Tahoma. Learn more on my personal website, [marinakochuten.github.io](https://marinakochuten.github.io).

## What I'm up to 
Currently, I am a Masters student in Environmental Data Science [(MEDS)](https://bren.ucsb.edu/masters-programs/master-environmental-data-science) at UCSBâ€™s Bren School of Environmental Science & Resource Management.
